+ **Task 1-3:**
  - If you're Dr. Koebbe, you'll know the results of these tasks.
+ **Task 4:**
  - Checkout [my HelloWorld.py](https://github.com/jaxtonw/math4610/tree/master/Tasksheet1/Task4) program in my Math 4610 repo.
+ **Task 5:**
  - If you're Dr. Koebbe, you'll know the results of this task.
+ **Task 6:**
  - Checkout [Difference Quotient](https://github.com/jaxtonw/math4610/tree/master/Tasksheet1/DifferenceQuotient) in my Math 4610 Repo.
+ **Task 7:**
  - Checkout [Error Approx](https://github.com/jaxtonw/math4610/tree/master/Tasksheet1/Errors) in my Math 4610 Repo. I also included a routine that returns the percent representation of a relative error.

+ **Task 9:**

+ **Task 10:**
  - Absolute and Relative errors are computationally similar, but produce very different results and are used in different contexts. An absolute error function will produce the absolute value of the difference between two values, x and estimatedX. This is useful when you want to know the actual quantity of your error between x and estimatedX. The relative error will produce the absolute value of the difference between the two values x and estimatedX, divided by the target value x. This produces a value which represents the magnitude of the error in relation to the actual quantity of x.
