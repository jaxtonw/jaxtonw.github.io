<p><span class="underline"><strong>Questions:</strong></span><br />
<strong>(1)</strong> Give a short description of what the preamble does in a LaTeX document.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> Certain commands are designed to only work in select LaTeX environments. For example, one cannot use <code>\pi</code> or <code>e^{x}</code> in a normal text environment, instead they have to be used within a seperate environment that is activated by surrounding the text in dollar signs (<code>$ ... $</code>). The single dollar signs are one way to activate and terminate what environment in LaTeX?<br />

<p><strong>(3)</strong> Let’s get to know you! What is your prospective major?<br />
</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> What personal or academic goals do you hope to accomplish this coming semester?<br />
</p>
<p><strong>(5)</strong> Use your google-fu to find some commands not listed above. In the area below, display 3 math symbols that are <span class="underline">not included</span> in the table above.<br />
